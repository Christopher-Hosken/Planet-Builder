# Planet Builder

Planet Builder is a command line script that will generate equirectangular textures from a specified spaceengine texture pack.

### Prerequisites

Planet Builder requires a few external python modules.
Make sure to run `pip install -r .\requirements.txt` before using the software.

You will also need to install the wanted texture pack from [Solar System HD](http://spaceengine.org/download/official-addons/solar-system-hd/) or [Solar System Ultra](http://spaceengine.org/download/official-addons/solar-system-uhd/)
