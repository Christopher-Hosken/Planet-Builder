# Planet Builder

Planet Builder is a Blender addon that builds high res planets from Solar System HD and Solar System Ultra textures.

### Installing the addon

To install the addon, you must first open blender and navigate to your preferences. Then in the Add-ons section, click 'Install...'. After that, planet-builder addon (It should be a .zip), select it, install it, and enable it. If you installed the prerequsites properly, you should be able to find a panel in your workspace panel.

## Documentation

You can find the Planet Builder addon in the Tool Properties panel. To use the addon, select one of the Solar System HD folders (the parent folder the posx, posy, etc. folders). 

Once you specify the folder, click what resolution the textures are, then press 'Make Textures'. This should take between 5 mins and 2 hours (depending on your PC specifications).

After making the textures, click 'Make Planet', and a planet will be built for you.
The 'x' next the 'Make Planet' button will wipe your scene of objects, meshes, textures, and materials. So be careful when pressing it.
